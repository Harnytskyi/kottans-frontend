## Git Basics
I've used Git before. But over time, I forgot a lot.
This lesson helped me refresh my knowledge.
I really liked the GitHub emulator. I have never seen anything like it before

## Linux CLI, and HTTP
I used to use Linux, but I didn't use these commands, it was new to me.
I've studied HTTP protocols before, so in part I already knew that.

I used to merge branches. The rest of the material was new for me.
